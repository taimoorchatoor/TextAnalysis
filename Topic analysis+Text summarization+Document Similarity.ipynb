But They Could End the Shutdown by Giving Him This.. Trump’s Wall Reportedly a Gimmick Campaign Aides Came Up With So He’d Remember to Talk Immigration                                      The Story of the American Arrested for Espionage in Russia Keeps Getting Stranger                            President Donald Trump made clear Sunday that he is still considering the possibility of declaring a national emergency in order to obtain the funds to build a wall along the border with Mexico.. “I may declare a national emergency dependent on what’s going to happen over the next few days,” Trump told reporters as he was getting ready to travel to Camp David on Sunday.. NEW: Pres.. Trump speaks to possibility of declaring a national emergency ahead of meetings with senior White House staff at Camp David: \"I may declare a national emergency dependent on what\\'s going to happen on the next few days.\". https://t.co/n7cpFSlMwt pic.twitter.com/0hRQco62jA— ABC News (@ABC) January 6, 2019          The words amount to a reiteration of something Trump raised Friday at a news conference.. When he acknowledged he was considering declaring a national emergency.. “Absolutely, we could call a national emergency because of the security of our county,” the president told reporters at a Rose Garden news conference.. “I haven’t done it.. I may do it.. I may do it.. But we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly.”        WATCH: President Trump says he is considering declaring a national emergency as a potential attempt to circumvent Congress for border wall funding.. pic.twitter.com/7CYDuBS2pn— NBC News (@NBCNews) January 4, 2019          A White House official told CNN on Saturday that the president was leaning toward declaring a national emergency in order get the funding.. While it wouldn’t be the administration’s preferred strategy to obtain financing for the wall, it “provides a way out” of the current impasse.. “We can only stay like this for so long,” the official said.. Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, said Trump had ordered his Cabinet to search within their budgets to try to find any bit of money that could be funneled to build the wall.. “The president has asked every single Cabinet secretary, and the Office of Management and Budget, to go out and find money that can be used legally to guard the southern border,” he said on CNN.. Mick Mulvaney on whether he supports President Trump using his emergency powers to fund the border wall: “I’m actually heavily involved with it and have been working with all the Cabinet secretaries to try and find money that we can legally use to defend the southern border” pic.twitter.com/tXcU0ddhXa— CNN (@CNN) January 6, 2019          Speaking on Fox, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that a national emergency to build a wall was certainly a possibility that was being analyzed.. “The president’s prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders, to protect the people of this country,” Sanders told Chris Wallace.. “He knows that the No.. 1 job he has as president and commander-in-chief is to protect its citizens.”                  Democrats, however, warned the president would face immediate legal challenges if he tried to declare a national emergency to build a wall.. Rep. Adam Schiff said he didn’t think Trump would be able to go through with his threat.. “Look, if Harry Truman couldn’t nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn’t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border,” Schiff said.. “So that’s a non-starter.”        Democratic Rep. @AdamSchiff says that President Trump potentially invoking emergency powers to fund the border wall is “a non-starter.” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/G4SOJQL8Uf pic.twitter.com/dYMDicirCU— CNN (@CNN) January 6, 2019          House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, meanwhile, said that while the president does have the authority to declare an emergency, any move toward that end would leave the administration “wide open” to a court challenge.. “Unfortunately, the short answer is yes.. There is a provision in law that says the president can declare an emergency.. It’s been done a number of times.. But primarily it’s been done to build facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq,” Smith said on ABC.. “In this case, I think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying, ‘where is the emergency?’ You have to establish that in order to do this.. But beyond that, this would be a terrible use of Department of Defense dollars.”        Rep. Adam Smith on whether Pres.. Trump has the authority to declare a national emergency and have the military build the wall: \"The short answer is yes,\" but Trump would be \"wide open to a court challenge, saying where is the emergency.\". https://t.co/Tm1bnHsp7t pic.twitter.com/DRlHAIPgqG— ABC News (@ABC) January 6, 2019Support our journalism                Help us continue covering the news and issues important to you—and                get ad-free podcasts and bonus segments,                members-only content, and other great benefits..

    "President Trump broke with his own intelligence agencies on Friday, appearing to accept Saudi Arabia’s explanation that the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by accident during a fistfight, while the United States’ spy agencies are increasingly convinced that he was assassinated on high-level orders from the Saudi royal court.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mr. Trump, who has cultivated Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and made Saudi Arabia the linchpin of his Middle East strategy, has been deeply reluctant to point a finger at the prince, despite evidence linking him to Saudi operatives who entered the country’s consulate in Istanbul the same day that Mr. Khashoggi disappeared there.\n",

    "\n",
    "The president said he still had questions for Prince Mohammed, and he called the killing of Mr. Khashoggi “unacceptable.” Mr. Trump also raised the possibility of sanctions against Saudi Arabia, but said that he hoped that Congress would not try to block billions of dollars in weapons sales to the kingdom, which he has held up as proof of the fruits of the alliance.\n",

    "Mr. Trump’s response sets up a clash with Congress, where Republicans and Democrats both tarred the Saudi explanation as lacking credibility.

    "\n",
    "The lawmaker, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said, “The kingdom and all involved in this brutal murder must be held accountable, and if the Trump administration will not take the lead, Congress must.”\n",

    "Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, declared in a Twitter post, “To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement.” He added, “It’s hard to find this latest ‘explanation’ as credible.”\n",
